# PA Motorcycle Safety Program Class Scraper

This script will scrape a table on the PA Motorcycle Safety Course site, and check if there are any available
spots for the next 10 courses. If a course is available, this script will send an email to you, from you, given
valid gmail credentials are supplied to the proper variables. If no courses are available, the script will continue
to run and check the page for availabilities every 5 minutes. Every 6 hours, an email will be sent as an indicator
that the script is alive and functioning... this is strictly for debugging purposes, and because I don't trust my
own programming skill level, so why should anyone else.
